       text: "Happy Birthday my Lovely Little Haruu Chan, \nSo where do i start, after all these amazing and beautiful messages what can I even write. Itll feel a bit bland. But well Lets start off from the beginning when we got into contact again when we were in 9th I still remember those days especially the one where you gave me tips for english exam and I went from C to A* in my mocks and ended up getting a A*. But i guess our true friendship started in AS, that night where I was lost and alone , you came like a shining angel and showed me a way out, and you kept on doing that. Always cheering me up and somehow always being there when I needed it the most. You say your cold maybe you are but even then I saw some cracks , where that warmth kept on slipping out. You say you can hurt or annoy others but to me it never was like that. I cant get annoyed by someone like you, you are a million years too young. As for the hurt part everyone gets hurt , you must have gotten hurt by me many times too , so its natural whats important is how we make up and be mature adults (not that i am one but still).I really really hope you do well in life, and I really wish to see you grow up and see what amazing things you'll do in life. So I am rooting for you, have big goals, and then achieve them dreams. You got it man. I have and will always Love you unconditionally no matter what, same with shadman , I consider you both family no maybe even more then that, and trust me when I say it but you are much much more amazing then you think. You say your not perfect , obviously no ones perfect no one in this world thats what makes us humans but how we grow and change from that is important and I think you are on the right path. Your level of maturity is something very rare which is something I really love about you, your responsible but hrum ahjumma its important to relax a bit too sometiems yk. And and one more thing No matter what it is if you ever need my help in anything (by anything i mean anything) let me know even if in the future if theres a point where we are not friends but you need me come to me without any issue Ill be there and itll be like nothing ever happened.But considering your sheer amount of friends you have I guess you wont need me ever or I wont be of that much help. But anyways its already a whole Book i have written. I pray that in the future you do well , you live a happy and fulfilling life with your parents and you achieve what ever you wish and you keep being the kind hearted girl you are.My blessings are with you .Love you always ,Bye Bye, \n ~Uzair."},
